            <p>
              The basis of this Affinity Diagram is in regards to 
              the lack of transportation opportunities at UOFSC. 
              The goal with this Diagram is to offer some methods 
              that may help this problem. These methods spread from
              social media awareness, obstacles to overcome, and ways to 
              access transportation.
