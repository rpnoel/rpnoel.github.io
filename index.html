            <p>
              The basis of this Affinity Diagram is in regards to 
              the lack of transportation opportunities at UOFSC. 
              The goal with this Diagram is to offer some methods 
              that may help this problem. These methods spread from
              social media awareness, obstacles to overcome, and ways to 
              access transportation.

            <p>
              Despite living near campus for over a year, Barry constantly finds himself without a reliable source of transportation, as he also doesn't own a car. 
              What he needs is an efficient method of getting around campus without stressing over the bus. Luckily, his roommate, Davis, 
              has just the solution, a brand new app that allows students to rent a method of transportation! The next week, Barry has his own personal scooter! 
              He can go all around campus now without having to worry about when or where the bus is going!
